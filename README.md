# FINAL-Project

### This project allowed us to act as a member for both the Blue and Red team. 

### For the Blue team, I used and ELK stack to be able to log events and set up alerts through Kibana. In conclusion, the alerts however, proved to not be very accurate in collecting the data in the intial setup and needed to be tweeked. Kibana was not flexible enough to manipulate alerts to our specificity. Here are the shippers we used to log data:
  - Filebeat
  - Metricbeat
  - Packetbeat

### For the Red Team, here are the tools I used:
  - NMap
  - John the Ripper
  - SSH
  - WPScan
  - MySQL
  - Python
